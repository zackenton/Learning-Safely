I've just set up this blog as a place to gather some thoughts on safety in machine learning. 

I plan to use it a bit like a diary, as I learn about this new subject. In that sense, it's mostly aimed at me, though I hope others can read it and take something from it too.

I'm planning to do one post a week about something interesting that I've read, either directly on safety or on other aspects of machine learning. I'll also post about some parts of safety policy and strategy as well.

I hope in particular this blog can help encourage others to get into safety. Please get in touch if you want to speak to me about safety, ML, data science, maths, physics or anything else! 

For this first post, I thought I'd link to this paper on arxiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.05137.pdf">One Model To Learn Them All </a> 

I'd like to interpret what this means for safety, which I'll do in the next blog.
