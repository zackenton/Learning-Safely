title: About 
---

I'm a mathematician, physicist and data scientist. I'm most interested in AI safety, specifically safety in machine learning. 

I'll be blogging here about machine learning safety research, beginning with what I'm reading, exercises I'm trying and code I'm developing.

I'm currently a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.asidatascience.com/">ASI Data Science</a>, where I apply machine learning techniques to real-world industry problems for a range of organisations and teach on the machine learning PhD Fellowship.

I just got my PhD in theoretical physics from Queen Mary University of London - you can see my academic profile <a href="http://strings.ph.qmul.ac.uk/directory/z.a.kenton">here</a>. I studied the maths that explains the expansion of the very early universe just a fraction of a second after the big bang. My thesis was on connecting the mathematical theory with observables from astronomical observations.

I originally trained as a Mathematician at Emmanuel College, Cambridge.
